The Rmd files require certain R packages to render the MPRWs, but only the "reshape2" package is needed in order to run the simulation. I recommend exporting to csv files or *recoding in another programming language*. The benefit of R is rapid prototyping, the downside is that generalization is slow. See the attached preprint research paper "Multiple particles colliding random walks" for a more detailed analysis of colliding random walks.



The Rmd files contain detailed comments for each and every single function and section as to hypothesis, code intention, and execution.
