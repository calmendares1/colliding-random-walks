The Rmd files require certain R packages to render the MPRWs, but only the "reshape2" package is needed in order to run the simulation. 

Detailed comments are provided for each and every single function and section as to hypothesis, code intention, and execution.

Apologies for the disorganization of the latest version of the file. It was originally constructed as a "do it all" kind of Rmd file. It suffers from a lot of bloat.
